#### Welcome to my GitHub profile
I am 18 years old passionate pythonista. I  
started my journey when I was 14 years  
old with game development in C# but I  
switched to Python becouse I can  
develop new things fast and it is realy  
simple to create business value. My goal  
is to become expert in Computer  
Science, especially in fields like Data  
Science and Backend Engineering.
